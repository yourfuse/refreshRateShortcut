Use CTRL-SHIFT-R to switch refresh rates in Windows 11.

So, the big issue for some of us who have horizontal lines on higher refresh rates, usually Ultra Wide monitors, there comes a tool that lets you quickly switch your refresh rate from a cold boot or from a longer monitor power off.

In our monitor case it took over 15 minutes sometimes before we could access the Display Settings! No more waiting for the lines to disapear just press CTRL-SHIFT-R to switch refresh rates.

Feel free to file issues and requests.
